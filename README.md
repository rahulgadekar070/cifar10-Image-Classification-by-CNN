# cifar10-Image-Classification-by-CNN
In this, we classify the different class of images by using CNN deep learning technique.

To classify the different class images, we use normal sequential layer model then for performance imporovement purpose, use the
Batch Normalization and Data Augmentation methods to avoid overfitting and model stabilty.

We got 88% training & 85.56% testing accuracy after 10 epochs by using Data Augmentation method on Batch Normalization model.
